## Sample 2: Templated CardBody

If you need to provide a custom content in the card body, place the content inside the control.

Bootstrap recommends the following CSS classes to be used in the card body templates:

* `h1`, ..., `h6` elements should have `card-title` or `card-subtitle` CSS classes.
* `p` and other text elements should have `card-text` CSS class.
* `a` elements should have `card-link` CSS class.

You can set `AddAppropriateCardClassesToContent` property to `true` which makes the control to add the CSS classes automatically based on the rules mentioned above.
