## Sample 5: Customizing Icons

The icons used by the control can be customized using the following inner elements:

* `ToggleIcon` represents an icon that opens the popup with color scale and predefined colors. The default is `Palette` icon.

* `UnselectIcon` represents an icon that allows the user to deselect the color. The default is `Close` icon.

* `EditorSwitchIcon` represents an icon that allows the user to switch between the RGB editor fields and one text field with the hex representation of the color. The default is `Switch` icon.

See the [Icon](~/controls/businesspack/Icon) documentation to find about using other icon packs.
