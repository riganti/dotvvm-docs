## Sample 3: Button Types

The `Button` control has the `ButtonTagName` property which specifies the tag rendered by the button. You can also choose whether it is a submit button or a normal button using the `IsSubmitButton` property.

The `Type` of the button can be set to `Primary`, `Secondary`, `Success`, `Info`, `Warning` and `Danger`. It will change the color and visual style.
