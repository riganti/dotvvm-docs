The `FileUpload` control has the `Data` property (of type `UploadData`). Each file will get a unique ID when it is uploaded. This ID will be then stored in the `Files` collection.

The `AllowMultipleFiles` property specifies whether the user can select multiple files in the file browser window. It also enables directory upload in modern browsers.
