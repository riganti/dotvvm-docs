## Sample 1: Basic Usage

The `DateTimePickerGroup` control has the `SelectedDate` property for storing the datetime the user has selected.
It needs to be bound to a property in the viewmodel.

The `LabelText` property is used to set the label of the `DateTimePickerGroup` control.

It is possible with the `Mode` property to change what you want the user to pick. 
Possible values are `Date` for only date, `Time` for only time and `DateTime` for both date and time.
