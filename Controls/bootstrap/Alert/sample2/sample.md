## Sample 2: Dismissible Alert

If you want to allow the user to hide the alert, use the `IsDismissible` property.
When `IsDismissible` property is set to true the close button will be rendered.

The `IsDismissed` property gets or sets if the Alert is dismissed.

The `Dismissed` event is called after the Alert is Dismissed.
