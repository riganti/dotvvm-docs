## Sample 1: Basic Usage

Use the `Value` property to get or set the selected date.

The control shares some properties with a [TextBox](~/controls/bootstrap5/TextBox). You can change its size with a `Size` property and change the state with the `Enabled` property. Additionally, you can set a command when the input changes with the `TextInput` property.

Since the control is just a styled HTML `input` element, the culture of the calendar and the first day of week is specified by the browser configuration, not by the request culture on the server.
