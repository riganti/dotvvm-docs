## Sample 1: Basic Collapsible

Put the collapsible content inside the control.

The `IsExpanded` property specifies whether the content is collapsed or expanded. The easiest way to expand or collapse is to use a link or button and switch the property using [Static Command Binding](~/pages/concepts/respond-to-user-actions/static-commands).
